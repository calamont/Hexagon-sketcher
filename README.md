Processing sketch which converts an image into tesselating hexagon objects, which are then filled in with strokes matching the pixel colour at that location. Gives a somewhat "sketchy" look. 

Can vary the size of the hexagons to give a random patchy look.

It is also possible to vary the number of lines filling the hexagons to give a gradient to the image.
